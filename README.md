## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js installed on your environment. Node can be easily installed from [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Node and npm versions used during development are:
```
$ node --version
v12.13.0

$ npm --version
6.12.0
```

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/ORG/PROJECT.git
    $ cd PROJECT
    $ npm install


## Configuration

Copy `Config.sample.js` to `Config.js` then edit it with your `API_KEY`.

You will use the API from themoviedb.org. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an
API Key. Follow [this link](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to get details on how to generate your API Key.
  

## Run

  

In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
